  <Question>
    <SubSubHeading>What kind of images does Redacted support?</SubSubHeading>
    <p>Redacted can work with any image you can open in Preview.</p>
  </Question>

  <Question>
    <SubSubHeading>Does Redacted support PDFs?</SubSubHeading>
    <p>Currently, no. Dealing with PDFs is extremely complicated. I'm holding off on PDF support until I can ensure I remove all of the redacted area from the document. This is something I definitely want to add in the future.</p>
  </Question>

  <Question>
    <SubSubHeading>Will you support an older version of macOS than Yosemite?</SubSubHeading>
    <p>Sorry, no. Redacted is built on top of the latest Apple technologies. You can upgrade to Yosemite for free in the App Store.</p>
  </Question>

  <Question>
    <SubSubHeading>Is the blur reversible?</SubSubHeading>
    <p>Technically, yes. This is the nature of blur algorithms. (You can read more about this <a href="https://dheera.net/projects/blur" rel="external nofollow">here</a>.) I have plans to make it much harder to reverse by adding random noise below the blur. That will be coming in a future version. If you want to redacted something very sensitive, use the black bar mode.</p>
  </Question>

  <Question>
    <SubSubHeading>Will you make a Windows or Android version?</SubSubHeading>
    <p>Sorry, no. Redacted it built on top of Apple’s technologies. Rewriting it for Windows or Android would take a ton of time that I’d rather spend working on new ideas.</p>
  </Question>

  <Question>
    <SubSubHeading>Who makes Redacted?</SubSubHeading>
    <p>Redacted was designed and developed by <a href="https://soff.es" rel="external nofollow">Sam Soffes</a>.</p>
